Things I would have worked on :

1)Seperated the status marking (red, green,blue) from the names into a seperate column.
2)DO the feature for show more, to show the next set of data
3)Sorting with date
4)Responsive design for mobile devices (current implementation should work well from ipad to browser)



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
